  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 1 Sep 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Socius (Get Connected)</strong> (“<strong>Socius</strong>”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). 
  This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices when using our mobile application and services (the “<strong>Service</strong>”). 
  By using Socius, you agree to this Policy.</p>

  <h2>1) What we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data</strong> you provide: name/username, email address, password hash (if you sign in with email), profile photo, and optional details (about, age, gender, interests, preferred locations).</li>
    <li><strong>Content you create</strong>: posts, images, videos, status updates, comments, and reactions, including basic upload metadata (time, device/OS, language).</li>
    <li><strong>Messages</strong>: 1-to-1 or group messages you send/receive are stored to deliver and sync chats and to enforce our Terms. We do not use message content for advertising.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & device data</strong>: app interactions, crash logs, device identifiers, IP address, and approximate location derived from IP for security and analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Media access</strong> (camera/photos): when you grant permission to take or upload photos/videos.</li>
    <li><strong>Location</strong> (when permitted): precise or coarse location to show nearby content or to tag content. We do not collect location in the background and you can deny this permission at any time in system settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) How we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Operate core features: account, feeds, media uploads, status, comments, and messaging.</li>
    <li>Personalize in-app experiences such as nearby or preferred-location content when location is enabled.</li>
    <li>Safety and moderation: reporting/blocking tools, abuse prevention, and legal compliance.</li>
    <li>Analytics, performance, and product improvement.</li>
    <li>Communications about service updates, security, and support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Android permissions we request & why</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><code>INTERNET</code>: connect to our servers and deliver content.</li>
    <li><code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> / <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code>: show nearby content or allow you to tag content with your location (only when you grant permission; no background tracking).</li>
    <li><code>CAMERA</code>: capture photos/videos to post or update your profile.</li>
    <li><code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> / <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>: pick media from your device and save app media (subject to Android’s scoped-storage rules).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Sign-in & service providers</h2>
  <p>You can sign in with email/password or with Google. We use <strong>Supabase</strong> (authentication, database, storage) and other cloud vendors that act as our processors under contract. We don’t sell your personal data and we don’t show third-party ad networks.</p>

  <h2>5) Sharing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With your direction</strong> when you post or share content.</li>
    <li><strong>With service providers</strong> that help us run the Service (hosting, storage, analytics, moderation) under confidentiality obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>For safety/legal reasons</strong> or during a business transfer as allowed by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Manage profile data and permissions (camera, photos, location) in your device settings.</li>
    <li>Use in-app tools to <strong>block</strong> or <strong>report</strong> users/content.</li>
    <li>Access, correct, or delete your information by contacting us (see Support) or through any in-app account controls we provide.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Data retention & deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>How to delete your account:</strong> open the app and go to <em>Profile</em> → scroll to the bottom and tap <em>Delete account</em>. Confirm the prompt to proceed.</li>
    <li>After you confirm, we remove your profile and content from our active systems. Any remaining copies in system backups are scheduled for secure purge (typically within 90 days). We may retain limited information if required by law or for safety/prevention of abuse.</li>
    <li>Messages you previously sent may remain in the recipient’s inbox and content others have copied/shared may persist with those users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Children</h2>
  <p>The Service is not for children below the age permitted by local law (typically 13, or 16 in certain regions). We remove ineligible accounts.</p>

  <h2>9) Security</h2>
  <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the data we process. No system is perfectly secure—use a strong, unique password and keep your device updated.</p>

  <h2>10) International transfers</h2>
  <p>Your data may be processed in countries different from your own. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.</p>

  <h2>11) Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy. If we make material changes, we’ll notify you in-app or by email and update the “Effective date”.</p>

  <h2>12) Support & contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions, requests, or wish to exercise your rights, contact our support team:</p>

  <p class="muted">This Policy summarizes our practices for Socius (Get Connected). Depending on your region, additional rights may apply.</p>
