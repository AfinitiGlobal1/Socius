  <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 1 Sep 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of
    <strong>Socius (Get Connected)</strong> (“<strong>Socius</strong>”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and all related
    services, features, and content (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”). By creating an account,
    tapping <em>Continue with Google</em> or <em>Continue with Email</em>, or using the Service, you agree to these Terms
    and to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>1) Who can use Socius</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be legally permitted to use the Service in your region (typically 13+ or 16+ in the EEA).</li>
    <li>You must provide accurate information and keep your account secure. You’re responsible for all activity
      under your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Your content &amp; license</h2>
  <p>“<strong>User Content</strong>” means anything you upload or create in Socius (posts, images, videos, status,
    comments, messages, profile info, etc.). You retain ownership of your User Content.</p>
  <p>You grant Socius a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, reproduce, modify (for formatting and
    display), publicly perform and display, and distribute your User Content solely for operating, improving, and
    promoting the Service. This license ends when your content is deleted from our systems, subject to reasonable
    technical and legal retention described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>3) Community rules</h2>
  <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Post or share illegal content; threats; hate or harassment; explicit sexual content or sexual exploitation;
      graphic violence; or anything that infringes others’ rights.</li>
    <li>Spam, scam, or attempt to phish, dox, or impersonate others.</li>
    <li>Interfere with the Service or attempt to reverse-engineer or circumvent security.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Socius provides <strong>report</strong> and <strong>block</strong> tools. We may remove content, restrict features, or suspend or
     terminate accounts that violate these Terms or our guidelines.</p>

  <h2>4) Messaging</h2>
  <p>Direct messages are intended for personal, lawful use. Do not send unsolicited or abusive messages.
     We may act on reports and on clear policy violations to keep the Service safe.</p>

  <h2>5) App permissions</h2>
  <p>The Android app may request the following permissions so features work as expected:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>INTERNET</code> – connect to our servers and deliver content.</li>
    <li><code>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> / <code>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code> – show nearby or preferred-location content
      when you opt in (no background tracking).</li>
    <li><code>CAMERA</code> – capture photos/videos for posts or your profile.</li>
    <li><code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> / <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> – pick and save media (subject to Android scoped-storage).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can manage or revoke permissions in your device settings at any time.</p>

  <h2>6) Account deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To delete your account: open the app and go to <em>Profile</em> → scroll to the bottom → tap
      <em>Delete account</em> and confirm.</li>
    <li>Deleting your account removes your profile and your content from active systems. Some items (e.g., messages
      already delivered to others) or backups may persist for a limited time as described in the Privacy Policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Moderation &amp; enforcement</h2>
  <p>We may remove or restrict any content or account if we reasonably believe it violates these Terms, our policies, or the law,
     or if it risks harm to users or the Service. We may also preserve information to comply with legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>8) Third-party services</h2>
  <p>We use trusted providers (e.g., Supabase for authentication/storage) to operate the Service. Links to third-party
     content are provided for convenience and are not endorsements. Their terms and privacy practices apply.</p>

  <h2>9) Intellectual property</h2>
  <p>The Service, including our logos, designs, and software, is protected by intellectual-property laws. Except
     for the limited license to use the app, no rights are granted to you. Do not copy, distribute, or modify the app
     except as allowed by law.</p>

  <h2>10) Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, Socius disclaims all warranties,
     express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
     We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.</p>

  <h2>11) Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Socius and its affiliates will not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
     special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of data or profits, arising from or in connection
     with your use of the Service.</p>

  <h2>12) Indemnity</h2>
  <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Socius from claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses
     (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your User Content, your use of the Service, or your breach of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>13) Changes to these Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we’ll notify you in-app or by email.
     Continued use after the effective date means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
